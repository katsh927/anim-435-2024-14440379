This file contains the code required for a Maya UI that loads camera data from a CSV file. 
Users can select a camera from the UI, which then sets the corresponding filmback size and focal length, as well as adds a framing chart image plane. There should now also be logging configuration visible in the script editor's topmost window with a custom formatter that shows timestamps, the logger name, and the function name. This is meant to make the user experience more efficient and pleasant. 

Features 
- Loads cameras from a CSV list.
- Allows selection of cameras from a UI control.
- Sets the filmback size and focal length.
- Adds a framing chart image plane to the selected camera.
- Welcome and error messages, and additional logging

Installation
1. Save the camera.csv file in the data folder within your Maya project.
2. Update the script with the correct path to the CSV file.
